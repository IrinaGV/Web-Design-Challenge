For this assignment I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from my past assignment. Specifically, I plotted weather data.
I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

-An explanation of the project.
-Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
-Four visualization pages have a descriptive title and heading tag,the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.

A "Comparisons" page that:
-Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so user can easily visually compare them.

I used a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table is bootstrap table component. Hint

The data was converted  to HTML. 


The website has a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
